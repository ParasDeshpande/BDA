1. Download the Iris flower dataset or any other dataset into a DataFrame. (eg
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris) Use Python/R and Perform following –
 How many features are there and what are their types (e.g., numeric, nominal)?
 Compute and display summary statistics for each feature available in the dataset.(eg. 
minimum value, maximum value, mean, range, standard deviation, variance and 
percentiles
 Data Visualization-Create a histogram for each feature in the dataset to illustrate the 
feature distributions. Plot each histogram.
 Create a boxplot for each feature in the dataset. All of the boxplots should be combined 
into a single plot. Compare distributions and identify outliers.

2. Download Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. Use Naive Bayes‟ Algorithm for classification
 Load the data from CSV file and split it into training and test datasets.
 Summarize the properties in the training dataset so that we can calculate probabilities and 
make predictions.
 Classify samples from a test dataset and a summarized training dataset.

4. Write a program that interacts with the weather database. Find the day and the station with the 
maximum snowfall in 2013

6. Trip History Analysis: Use trip history dataset that is from a bike sharing service in the United 
States. The data is provided quarter-wise from 2010 (Q4) onwards. Each file has 7 columns. 
Predict the class of user. Sample Test data set available here 
https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/trip-history-data

8. Twitter Data Analysis: Use Twitter data for sentiment analysis. The dataset is 3MB in size and 
has 31,962 tweets. Identify the tweets which are hate tweets and which are not. Sample Test 
data set available here https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practiceproblemtwitter-sentiment-analysis/
